Get started with GitHub for the summer

Clone and then fork this repo and then answer the questions below. Afterwards submit a pull request on the original repo so that I can capture your GitHub account name and set up your team repo for the class.
These will be PRIVATE repos so only you and I as course organiser can see what you put into this repo.

## Over the summer I want to ...
Ans: Deepen by knowledge in Python development by reading and engaging in a number of personal projects.

What's your goal for this course?

Ans: 

## The best part of group projects is ...
What do you see when it goes well?
Ans:That someone/people may not do what is expected of them, which will mean the rest of the team will have to do that work, hopefully not under deadline pressure.
The other thing I worry about is that I may be the one who is unable to complete my task, which will make me look inept and then cause my work to be taken on by the team.
